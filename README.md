# TwitterApp

# How run:
  1. The only requirement for commissioning is to have a docker.
  2. In the docker-compose.yaml file in the backend section, complete the baererKeyArg argument with the baerer key from the twitter development account.
  3. Run the terminal in the location where the docker-compose.yaml file is located, and then execute the "docker-compose up -d" command

- The first run of the backend may take a bit longer
- Optionally, you can change more data in the docker-compose file, if, for example, you want to use an external database
